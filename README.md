Explore the implementation of memory in language models for building conversational agents using Lang chain.

## Introduction

This repo addresses the importance of memory in language models, especially in the context of large language models like Lang chain. It focuses on enhancing the conversational experience by handling co-reference resolution and recalling previous interactions.

## Memory Options

### 1. Conversation Buffer Memory

Tracks and stores the entire conversation in the prompt, suitable for scenarios with limited interactions.

### 2. Conversation Summary Memory

Summarizes the conversation instead of storing the full history, useful when a brief overview is sufficient.

### 3. Conversation Buffer Window Memory

Maintains a window of the last few interactions, balancing memory efficiency and completeness.

### 4. Combined Summary and Buffer Memory

Hybrid approach providing both a summarized version and a buffer of recent interactions.

### 5. Knowledge Graph Memory

Represents the conversation as a knowledge graph, extracting relevant information and relationships between entities.

### 6. Entity Memory

Focuses on extracting specific entities from the conversation, useful for structured information.
